[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/whatisaphone/war/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/whatisaphone/war/commits/master)

A tool that lets you view/edit [Darksiders] save files and game assets.

[Darksiders]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darksiders_(video_game)

>Darksiders Warfinitive Edition - All your save game are belong to us!

## How to use

Run `war --help` for the full list of commands. Or, continue reading for the guided tour.

- [Save editing](#save-editing)
- [Asset extracting](#asset-extracting)

### Save editing

Which edition of the game do you have?

<details>
<summary><b>OG</b></summary>

Your saves should be in a path that looks something like this:

    C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\Darksiders\<steam-user-id>\dsauto.dsav

- Run `war dsav decode <path-to-dsav>` to decode a save from `.dsav` to `.json`.
- The newly-created `.json` will have an unpacked version of your save. You can edit this file.
- Run `war dsav encode <path-to-json>` to encode back to `.dsav`.
- To use the new save, just quit to the main menu and choose "Load Game".

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Warmastered</b></summary>

Your saves should be in a path that looks something like this:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<steam-user-id>\462780\remote\autocloud\save\keen_savegame_0_0.sav

The file contains all 10 save slots (including the autosave slot), but this tool only reads/writes the autosave slot.

- Run `war sav decode <path-to-sav>` to decode the autosave to `.json`.
- The newly-created `.json` will have an unpacked version of your save. You can edit this file.
- Run `war sav encode <path-to-sav> <path-to-json>` to write back to the `.sav`. The autosave slot will be overwritten, and the other save slots will be left alone.
- If the game is running, you'll need to exit and restart for it to read the new data. Unfortunately, this edition only reads the save file once when the game first loads.

</details>

âš  **NOTE** (both editions): Darksiders will refuse to load a save if the `SaveGameInfo`'s `UserId` does not match the logged-in Steam user's ID. If you want to use a save on a different account than created it, the `UserId` property must be changed to match.

### Asset extracting

This app can extract the game's worlds and scripts to a readable format. It cannot re-pack them into the original format. These command work just as well on files from both OG and Warmastered.

#### Worlds

The game's worlds are stored in `/path/to/Darksiders/media/worlds.mnfst`. To extract them, run:

```sh
war worlds decode <path-to-worlds.mnfst> <output-dir>
```

The game's universe is broken into a hierarchy of **World** > **Region** > **Layer**, and that hierarchy will be preserved in the output directory tree. For example, in this partial output, the world is **overworld**, the region is **Council**, and the layer is **Lights**:

```text
output-dir/
â”œâ”€ overworld.json
â””â”€ overworld/
   â”œâ”€ Council.json
   â””â”€ Council/
      â””â”€ Lights.json
```

#### Scripts

The game's scripts are stored in `/path/to/Darksiders/media/scripts.obsp`. To extract them, run:

```sh
war obsp decode <path-to-scripts.obsp> <output-dir>
```

Congratulations, you did it! Now you have several thousand more files on your hard drive. ðŸŽ‰
